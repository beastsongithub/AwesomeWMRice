hello this is a rice of awesomewm , I wont guarantee it works fine on your system as there are some hardcoded and spaces, widths,heights ,etc... in it . you may need to change it .\
also change the autostart.sh file to autostart your programs. you may want to add animations to it with rubato or sth else , personally i don't use them.\
